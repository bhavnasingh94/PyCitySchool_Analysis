# PyCitySchool_Analysis
## Project Overview
The school board had found and notified Maria and her supervisor that there had been alteration in the grades for 9th grade Mathematics and Reading classes of Thomas High School.
In order to uphold the state-testing standards, they have asked to replace the Math and Reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs whilst keeping the rest of data intact. Once that is complete, Maria and her supervisor were to run the district analysis again to show how the changes affected the overall analysis compared to the previous analysis.
## Analysis
- The school summary was impacted for Thomas High School as the average for their 9th grade Math and Reading scores went from 83.41 to 59.85 and 83.84 to 60.24, respectively. 
- Thomas High School was the 2nd top performing school in the district prior to the revision. After the revision, Thomas High School is now showing to be one of the lowest performing school

- There were minimal changes noted to the overall district summary for average of Reading and Math scores. Reading scores went from 81.87 to 80.89, while Math 78.98 to 78.00.
- The 9th graders received a 0 in their Reading and Math scores while grades 10th, 11th, and 12th, maintained their scores.
## Conclusion
All scores were impacted negatively after removal of Thomas High School's Reading and Math scores in: school spending, school types, school size, overall district analysis, tracking how well the school is doing compared to other schools in the district.
